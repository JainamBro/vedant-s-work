        <b><p>Who is the Owner of this team ?</p></b>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team is operated by Ducati Corse, the racing division of Ducati Motor Holding S.p.A., which in turn is part of the Audi AG group under Volkswagen. The title partnership with Lenovo officially began in 2021, with Lenovo providing advanced technological support ever since.</p>
        <b><p>Origin of the team</p></b>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ducati’s MotoGP presence emerged from its racing division, with Lenovo entering as a technology partner in 2018. In 2021, the collaboration evolved into the fully titled Ducati Lenovo Team, combining Italian racing heritage with tech innovation from Lenovo.</p>
        <b><p>Achievemet of the team</p></b>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team has demonstrated outstanding success: in 2022 they achieved the coveted MotoGP Triple Crown—winning the Riders’, Constructors’, and Teams’ World Championships. In 2024, they dominated again with 19 wins out of 20 races, secured a fifth consecutive Constructors’ title, and won the Teams’ Championship.</p>
        <b><p>Formed in which year</p></b>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Ducati Corse has competed in MotoGP for many years, the Ducati Lenovo Team brand was officially formed in 2021 when Lenovo became the title sponsor.</p>
        <b><p>Years with major wins</p></b>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Significant triumphs include the 2022 Triple Crown, continued dominance across 2023 and 2024 with championship wins and race supremacy, including over 100 career wins as a constructor.</p>
